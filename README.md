# Overview
This project presents a visualization in R of the cholera outbreak in the London neighborhood of Soho by John Snow. It highlights the significance of data journalism and spatial analysis in understanding and combating infectious diseases.

# Precedents
The cholera outbreak on Broad Street, London, in 1854, was a pivotal event studied by John Snow. Utilizing data mapping techniques, Snow tracked cases and discovered a clustering of cholera cases around a water pump on Broad Street. His analysis revealed a clear pattern of cholera spread related to water quality, leading to crucial insights into infectious disease transmission. Snow's work laid the foundation for modern epidemiological research and prompted reforms in public health practices, particularly in sanitation and water supply systems.
