# Precedents
The cholera outbreak on Broad Street, London, in 1854, was studied by John Snow, who used data mapping to track cases. Snow found that most cases were clustered around a water pump on Broad Street. This analysis revealed a clear pattern of cholera spread related to water quality. His discovery was crucial for understanding infectious diseases and led to improvements in public health. This innovative approach laid the groundwork for future epidemiological research and reforms in sanitation and water supply systems. Snow transformed the way infectious diseases were addressed, emphasizing the importance of data mapping in epidemiological investigation.
